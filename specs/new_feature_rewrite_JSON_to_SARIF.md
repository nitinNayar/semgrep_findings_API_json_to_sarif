Lets now look at the JSON to SARIF mapping and SARIF generation

I compared the SARIF file generated by our python app @output/results_3324447.sarif with the correct SARIF OUTPUT We MUST GET
Looks like we are missing a few mandatory fields- here is my list (may not be complete & com )
Also some of the mapping are incorrect

Can you do a detailed comparison of these 2 SARIF files and identify the differences and document them in @specs/SARIF_differences.md
